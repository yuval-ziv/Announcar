# Announcarr

Announcarr is a notification service for Radarr, Sonarr and Overseerr.
It can work with multiple instances of them, for example a regular Radarr and a 4K Radarr.
There is also support for multiple exporters, even from the same type, such as your own private chat with the Telegram bot, or a group chat with your server's users.
